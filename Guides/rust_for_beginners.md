# Rust for Beginner Programmers
Rust is not typically seen as a language suitable for
beginners. It is true that it has many useful features that
can be tricky to grasp, but I believe with careful and
methodical explaining it could be made accessible to new
programmers. To me it seems simple that the biggest barrier
to entry is the unwillingness to explain the basics. People
seem to feel you should have those down when coming in to
Rust, and yet these basics that the person "should" have
when coming to Rust are not agreed upon. Does the Python
language cover these basics? Or the C language, or heaven
forbid Javascript?
I don't know, but I have a suspicion that this guide may be
useful to many without a computer science degree trying out
their second language, as well as those who choose Rust as
their first. But alas, who knows, this is for you to judge,
not I.
