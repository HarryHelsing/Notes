# My Ideas
### A collection of random, often strange techy ideas
Here I will plonk, without restraint, my unfiltered ideas
regarding Linux and Systems Administration, Rust and
programming, and any other tech related ideas.
Some may be overly complex, ambitious, or just kind of
pointless, but you never know, best store it all and mine
for gold at a later date.
Have fun reading!
- Perhaps try making multiple dummy users on AlmaLinux and
  get used to managing permisions in various ways.
- I could practice my documentation skills by trying to
  make a guide for Rust as a first programming language.
  Since I started with Rust as my first language this could
  be a valuable tool for others who wish to do the same.
  I think the only thing that holds Rust back from being
  a beginner friendly language is the documentation. It's
  not aimed at beginners, but it could be. Sure it's no
  python, but if people could start with assembly or C as
  their first language, then they can start with Rust.
