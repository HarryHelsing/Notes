# My Experiments
### An ordered list of my various tech related experiments
This list will show what I have attempted, my reflections,
as well as potential future refinements. It is intended for
myself and others who wish to see my progress, train of
thinking, and what I have been doing.

- Troubleshooting AlmaLinux install on old laptop. Perhaps
  trying the minimal install ISO would solve this.
- Minimal ISO did not work. I will check the compatibility
  with AlmaLinux and my hardware.
- I am trying AlmaLinux 9 instead of 10, perhaps there will
  be better support for older hardware. There still should
  be a good 7 years of security updates in that version
  presuming AlmaLinux follows Red Hat's security support
  timeline.
- AlmaLinux 9 warned me that my laptop was deprecated
  hardware. I got a kernal panic not syncing error. Time to
  try AlmaLinux 8! The journey continues.
- Success! AlmaLinux 8 installed. I am faced with the quiet
  black and white blinking of the terminal, though I am
  very comfortable in the terminal and use it frequently
  on my desktop or in a tty when needed, being confronted
  with this stark potential yet lack of direction that
  comes when working without a gui, I feel a mix of
  excitement and mild dread as it dawns on me that I will
  be living here for a long time. My new home, a black
  space where the only stars are the soft grey white
  characters that inform minimally, but clearly.
- Navigating in the dark, my first time using vi, since
  vim was not preinstalled. Quite exciting. Though after
  some research it seems the extra features provided by
  vim are not fluff, in fact they're quite useful, and as
  long as I'm comfortable switching to vi when needed, I
  see no harm in installing vim.
- Ahhh, permission issues. My main account is not in the
  sudoers file, apparently this incident will be reported.
  As I am the one running the root account it appears I
  have been reported to myself. Do not worry, I shall not
  succumb to my own bias, I can be trusted to judge these
  attempts of breaching privilege with a stern and swift
  justice.
- Frustratingly the wifi, which was working in the
  installation process now appears to have gone caput.
  After running 'nmcli device' it appears that the wifi
  is "unmanaged" whatever that means.
- I have been lead to editing network config files to get
  my wifi drivers to run. It hasn't worked yet and I find
  myself in the many halls and rooms of the Linux operating
  system. A sinking feeling in my stomach. I wonder, will
  the hallways of Linux come to an end? Will I ever truly
  know these roads? Or do these halls stretch on to
  infinity? Fractal directories opening into yet more
  directories, with their unrelenting jargon and refusal
  to explain themselves.
  As I clamber through the directories I come across
  shifty config files, offering me promises of power
  and agency over my machine, but I can tell from the
  look in their eye that I am most certainly dicing with
  death, or at the very least bizarre bugs and more
  bloody headaches trying to get things to work properly.
- Personal note: I am sulking now. I am trying to rewire
  my usual instinct to plough through until it does what I
  want but since my goal is understanding and correctness
  that would be a foolish approach. I am trying to turn
  over every stone to understand my environment. I must
  have faith that the halls are not so unending, or at
  least that the main corridors that connect these halls
  will, eventually, become familiar and homely, even if
  mystery still lurks within the further regions of the
  great Gormenghastian castle of Linux.
- Time for a break, after a few hours and several rabbit
  holes I still have not managed to install vim. Writing
  these notes is really helping discharge the extreme
  cognative frustration of simple things I'm used to just
  working suddenly and simply not.

- Removing keyboard, battery, and track pad from old laptop
  to make AlmaLinux server. Removing the battery helps
  reduce safety concerns and energy consumption. Removing
  the keyboard and trackpad is to force to to getting more
  comfortable in the terminal and simulate the workflow of
  being a server admin.
  I am also replacing the top of the laptop with a
  transparent plastic panel to view the internals of the
  laptop, because it looks cool, that simple!
