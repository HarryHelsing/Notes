# My Experiments
### An ordered list of my various tech related experiments
---
This list will show what I have attempted, my reflections,
as well as potential future refinements. It is intended for
myself and others who wish to see my progress, train of
thinking, and what I have been doing.

- Troubleshooting AlmaLinux install on old laptop. Perhaps
  trying the minimal install ISO would solve this.
- Minimal ISO did not work. I will check the compatibility
  with AlmaLinux and my hardware.
- I am trying AlmaLinux 9 instead of 10, perhaps there will
  be better support for older hardware. There still should
  be a good 7 years of security updates in that version
  presuming AlmaLinux follows Red Hat's security support
  timeline.
- AlmaLinux 9 warned me that my laptop was deprecated
  hardware. I got a kernal panic not syncing error. Time to try  AlmaLinux 8! The journey continues.
- Success! AlmaLinux 8 installed. I am faced with the quiet
  black and white blinking of the terminal, though I am
  very comfortable in the terminal and use it frequently
  on my desktop or in a tty when needed, being contronted
  with this stark potential yet lack of direction that
  comes when working without a gui, I feel a mix of
  excitement and mild dread as it dawns on me that I will
  be living here for a long time. My new home, a black
  space where the only stars are the soft grey white
  characters that inform minimally, but clearly.
- Navigating in the dark, my first time using vi, since
  vim was not preinstalled. Quite exciting. Though after
  some research it seems the extra features provided by
  vim are not fluff, in fact they're quite useful, and as
  long as I'm comfortable switching to vi when needed, I
  see no harm in installing vim.
- Ahhh, permission issues. My main account is not in the
  sudoers file, apparently this incident will be reported.
  As I am the one running the root account it appears I
  have been reported to myself. Do not worry, I shall not
  succumb to my own bias, I can be trusted to judge these
  attempts of breaching privilege with stern and swift
  justice.

- Removing keyboard, battery, and track pad from old laptop
  to make AlmaLinux server. Removing the battery helps
  reduce safety concerns and energy consumption. Removing
  the keyboard and trackpad is to force to to getting more
  comfortable in the terminal and simulate the workflow of
  being a server admin.
  I am also replacing the top of the laptop with a
  transparent plastic panel to view the internals of the
  laptop, because it looks cool, that simple!
