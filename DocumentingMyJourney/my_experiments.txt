- Removing keyboard, battery, and track pad from old laptop
  to make AlmaLinux server. Removing the battery helps
  reduce safety concerns and energy consumption. Removing
  the keyboard and trackpad is to force to to getting more
  comfortable in the terminal and simulate the workflow of
  being a server admin.
  I am also replacing the top of the laptop with a
  transparent plastic panel to view the internals of the
  laptop, because it looks cool, that simple!
