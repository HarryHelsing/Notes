# My Experiments
### An ordered list of my various tech related experiments
---
This list will show what I have attempted, my reflections,
as well as potential future refinements. It is intended for
myself and others who wish to see my progress, train of
thinking, and what I have been doing.

- Troubleshooting AlmaLinux install on old laptop. Perhaps
  trying the minimal install ISO would solve this.
- Minimal ISO did not work. I will check the compatibility
  with AlmaLinux and my hardware.
- I am trying AlmaLinux 9 instead of 10, perhaps there will
  be better support for older hardware. There still should
  be a good 7 years of security updates in that version
  presuming AlmaLinux follows Red Hat's security support
  timeline.

- Removing keyboard, battery, and track pad from old laptop
  to make AlmaLinux server. Removing the battery helps
  reduce safety concerns and energy consumption. Removing
  the keyboard and trackpad is to force to to getting more
  comfortable in the terminal and simulate the workflow of
  being a server admin.
  I am also replacing the top of the laptop with a
  transparent plastic panel to view the internals of the
  laptop, because it looks cool, that simple!
